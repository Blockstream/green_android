# Green - A native Blockstream wallet for iOS

Blockstream Green is a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet - it allows you to safely store, send, and receive your Bitcoin.

It's a mobile app available for [Android](https://github.com/Blockstream/green_android) and [iOS](https://github.com/Blockstream/green_ios), based on [gdk](https://github.com/blockstream/gdk), our cross-platform wallet library.

We offer a variety of advanced features, such as letting our users set their own spending limits, watch-only access for observers, and our unique multisig security model.
All of these (and more) are explained in more detail [here](https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/sections/900000129826-Getting-Started).
